# Check_wine_quality

## Wine Quality Classifier

This project aims to classify the quality of red wines based on various chemical features. It uses a random forest classifier to predict whether a wine is of good or bad quality.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [winequality-red.csv]

## Upon running the project, you will see the following output:

- Information about the dataset (number of rows, columns, and statistical measures).
- Plots showing the distribution of wine qualities, volatile acidity vs. quality, citric acid vs. quality, and a heatmap of feature correlations.
- The accuracy of the trained model on the test data.
- A prediction of the quality (good or bad) for a given set of wine features.
